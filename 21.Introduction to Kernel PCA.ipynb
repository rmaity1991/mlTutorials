    "### PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS: \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a tool which is used to reduce the dimension of the data. It allows us to reduce the dimension of the data without much loss of information. PCA reduces the dimension by finding a few orthogonal linear combinations (principal components) of the original variables with the largest variance. The first principal component captures most of the variance in the data. The second principal component is orthogonal to the first principal component and captures the remaining variance, which is left of first principal component and so on. There are as many principal components as the number of original variables. These principal components are uncorrelated and are ordered in such a way that the first several principal components explain most of the variance of the original data. To learn more about PCA you can read the article Principal Component Analysis \n",

    "### KERNEL PCA: \n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is a linear method. That is it can only be applied to datasets which are linearly separable. It does an excellent job for datasets, which are linearly separable. But, if we use it to non-linear datasets, we might get a result which may not be the optimal dimensionality reduction. Kernel PCA uses a kernel function to project dataset into a higher dimensional feature space, where it is linearly separable. It is similar to the idea of Support Vector Machines. There are various kernel methods like linear, polynomial, and gaussian. \n",

    "### Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) :\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a technique used in machine learning for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. It is an extension of the classical Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, which is a linear method that identifies the most significant features or components of a dataset. KPCA applies a nonlinear mapping function to the data before applying PCA, allowing it to capture more complex and nonlinear relationships between the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In KPCA, a kernel function is used to map the input data to a high-dimensional feature space, where the nonlinear relationships between the data points can be more easily captured by linear methods such as PCA. The principal components of the transformed data are then computed, which can be used for tasks such as data visualization, clustering, or classification."

    "One of the advantages of KPCA over traditional PCA is that it can handle nonlinear relationships between the input features, which can be useful for tasks such as image or speech recognition. KPCA can also handle high-dimensional datasets with many features by reducing the dimensionality of the data while preserving the most important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, KPCA has some limitations, such as the need to choose an appropriate kernel function and its corresponding parameters, which can be difficult and time-consuming. KPCA can also be computationally expensive for large datasets, as it requires the computation of the kernel matrix for all pairs of data points."
