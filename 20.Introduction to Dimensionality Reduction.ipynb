    "Dimensionality reduction involves decreasing the quantity of features (or dimensions) in a dataset while trying to maintain maximal information. This practice serves various purposes, including simplifying model complexity, enhancing learning algorithm efficiency, or facilitating data visualization. Numerous methods exist for this purpose, such as principal component analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Each method employs distinct approaches to map the data onto a lower-dimensional plane while preserving critical information.\n",

    "In machine learning, high-dimensional data means data containing numerous features or variables. The problem of dimensionality represents a challenge in machine learning, where the model's effectiveness declines as the number of features grows. This phenomenon occurs because the model's complexity increases with the feature count, making it harder to discover an optimal solution. Moreover, high-dimensional data can lead to overfitting, where the model excessively tailors itself to the training data and performs poorly on new data. To address this, two primary methods for dimensionality reduction exist: feature selection and feature extraction.\n",

    "Feature selection is the process of choosing a subset of the initial features that are most important to the problem being addressed. Its objective is to reduce the dataset's dimensionality while retaining the most crucial features. Various methods are available for feature selection, including filter, wrapper, and embedded methods. Filter methods rank features based on their relevance to the target variable, wrapper methods use model performance to select features, and embedded methods integrate feature selection into the model training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, feature extraction involves generating new features by combining or transforming the original ones. The aim is to create a feature set that captures the information of the original data in a lower-dimensional space. Several techniques exist for feature extraction, such as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). PCA, for instance, is a popular method that projects the original features into a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much variance as possible.\n"
